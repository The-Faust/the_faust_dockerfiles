# The Faust's Dockerfiles
This repository is composed of my personal dockerfiles

## Why keep them here?
To me it seems easier to keep my dockerfiles as separate projects that can be reused at a later date and it helps in preventing my project to get somewhat bloated

## How are they updated?
Everytime I push modifications and merge them to master the modifications are pushed to dockerhub trhough circleci
